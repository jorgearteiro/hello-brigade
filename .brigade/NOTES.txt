This file was created by brig init and outlines next steps.

1. Edit project.yaml as you see fit and submit it to Brigade using:

     brig project create -f .brigade/project.yaml

2. If your project needs to make use of any secret/sensitive values, set them
   one at a time using:

     brig project secrets set --id hello-brigade --set <key>=<value>

   Or set secrets in bulk by modifying secrets.yaml, then submit them to
   Brigade using:

     brig project secrets set --id hello-brigade --file .brigade/secrets.yaml

   Secrets become available within your brigade.ts script using:

     event.project.secrets.<key>

   Take great care in how you use secrets so they are not leaked into worker or
   job logs.

   Note that Brigade keeps all jobs' environment variables secret, so it is safe
   to inject your secrets into a job's environment. This action will not
   implicitly expose your secrets. Take care that the jobs themselves don't leak
   secrets into their logs.

   DO NOT commit secrets to source control. brig init has already added
   .brigade/secrets.yaml to your .gitignore file.
